# CRUD-Project
CRUD Project using Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB

In this project, I have used Express framework, MongoDB database and Node JS server environment. MVC architecture is used to design this application. Also, Bootstrap is used to beautify the web pages. Two separate web pages are included one for inserting, reading and deleting data and other for updating existing data.
